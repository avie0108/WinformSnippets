This is the designer here you can add and edit components of your window.

## Adding components to your form

You can see the components in the toolbox. Open the tool box (View > Toolbox or `Ctrl + W, X`) and search for button.

you can change this button in various ways in the properties panel. the properties panel can be found at the bottom right of your screen. If you can't find the properties window, you can open it in the View tab or with the shortcut `Ctrl + W, P`. As an example you can change the `Text` Property to `Click me!`.
